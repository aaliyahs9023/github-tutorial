## Git vs. GitHub
Git keeps track of your older code by taking snapshots. Github then takes that code and stores it in the clode which is also the internet.The difference between the two is github needs git but git doessn't need git.

## Initial Setup
* First go to [github](https://github.com/)
* Then click on the upper right corner where it says sign up
* After you want to create a username something easy to remember (or if you are apart of HSTAT use your email but take out @hstat.org)
* Then input your email adress
* Finally create a password and press the "sign up for github" button and you're finished
