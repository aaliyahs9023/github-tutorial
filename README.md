## Git vs. GitHub
**Git** keeps track of your older code by taking snapshots.  

**Github** then takes that code and stores it in the clode which is also the internet.The difference between the two is github needs git but git doessn't need git.


---
## Initial Setup
* First go to [github](https://github.com/)
* Then click on the upper right corner where it says sign up **if you DONT have an account**
* After you want to create a username something easy to remember (or if you are apart of HSTAT use your email but take out @hstat.org)
* Then input your email adress
* Finally create a password and press the "sign up for github" button 
* After that when you are creating your repo there will be a key that says SSH and copy and paste that first link to [c9.io](https://c9.io/login)
